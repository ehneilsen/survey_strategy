Attempting to list all of the science (and other) metrics in use. 

SRD
---
* fO
* number of visits
* coadded depth
* area with rapid revisits
* parallax error
* proper motion error
* - fraction of visits with individual image depth r > r_D + 0.3
* - fraction of visits with IQ in r or i band > 1.1"

Solar System
------------
* Population completeness as a function of H and time (NEO, MBA, Trojan, TNO)
* Fraction of population with likelihood for lightcurve inversion (NEO, MBA)
* Fraction of population with likelihood for color measurements in 2/3/4/5 colors (NEO, MBA, Trojan)
* Fraction of population with likelihood for color measurements with lightcurve (TNO)
* - Comets and Active asteroids
